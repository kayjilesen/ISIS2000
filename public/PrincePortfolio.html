                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Prince Nash, and I am a current student at SUU studying Information Systems with an
                    emphasis on Cyber Security. I was born and raised in a city called White Plains, NY where I stayed
                    until I was 21 years old, then I moved to Georgia where after 3 1/2 years I joined the Marine
                    Corps.
                    I came to SUU in 2016 after my tour of duty in the Marines, however I did not start my first
                    semester until Spring of 2017.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I first got into computers in general when I first tried them in High School, and back then they
                    were vastly more expensive then they are today, they even restricted who can use them and when. I
                    experimented on many different things when I had my chances to use computers; from website
                    building, to simply learning how they "tick," and since then my interest only grew. You can see the
                    original website I built <a href="http://trueomega.angelfire.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h1>Web Development Class</h1>
                <p>When I first started the class I had some general idea of what we as a class were going to do, and that was make a website. However, it was only the general tip of the iceberg as to what we did. As I said, due to the website I created, I knew some of the ins and outs of HTML, but when it came time to using CSS I was at a complete loss as it was someething I had never done before. However, after some practice it was very simple to understand.</p>
                <br>
                <p>About halfway through the class we started to learn about Javascript, which is far more difficult than CSS as it is very complex, and one wrong letter or number out of place and something would not work as intended. As with CSS initially I was at a complete loss, and in some ways I still am as understand what goes where, and when, is very complicated and easy to forget without a lot of practice.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Everyone is different in terms of learning the scripting, and different types of code. And at the end of the class I believe that, while I am no where near an expert, I feel I made a large leap forward in terms of how to build a website, and possibly more in the future.</p>
