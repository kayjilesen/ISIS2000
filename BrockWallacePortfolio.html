        <h2>About</h2>
        My name is Jared and I am a student at Southern Utah University studying Information Systems. I am a Senior and will be graduating
        early 2020.  I was born in San Antonio, TX and after moving a few times I finished high school in North Manchester,
        IN before moving to Utah for college.  Probably due in part to my being raised in a few different states, I have
        always been fond of traveling and have visited every state in the US except Alaska and hope to go there soon as a
        graduation gift to myself.
        <br>
        <br> I first became interested in computers at an early age, watching my dad building computers. He was a technical
        engineer at Intel and always had a new computer project to work on. When I turned 15 I got a job and with my first
        paycheck went to an electronics fair in Indianapolis with my dad and purchased all of the parts I would need to build
        my first computer and I have been working on computers ever since.  Now, I am a computer technician at Mountain West
        Computers while attending school and have been working there since April of 2016.
